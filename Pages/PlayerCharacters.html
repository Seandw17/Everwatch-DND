                <h2>Quake</h2>
                <img src="/Images/Quake.jpg" alt="A high elf wizard casting spells">
                <p>A Female High Elf Wizard, born in Arvandor to a non particularly wealthy family Quake began to show signs of a natural talent with magic, one night her father returned home and spoke to her mother about a travelling wizard he had encountered. Telling the stranger of his daughters abilities the wizard became quite interested on taking this child with them to Tralnorth school of wizardry, initially Quakes mother was furious but realised that this would allow Quake to explore her new magic and would allow her to become something more than a basic commoner. The parents agreed and met with the travelling wizard and said their final farewells to Quake.</p>
                <p>Quakes studies at Tralnorth quickly grabbed the attention of the higher masters as her natural talent allowed her to understand complex spells easier than her classmates, a higher master by the name of Kelkian Yelastroth become quite interested in Quake and began to keep a keen eye on her as she progressed through her studies. As she grew and her natural talent allowed her to excel Kelkain offered Quake the position of his apprentice. Quake took this and became one of the youngest students to be taken on by a higher master.</p>
                <p>Through her private studies with Kelkain, Quake had a far better understanding of al her previous studies as well as the universe around her, this also led to Quake becoming one of the youngest teaching masters that Tralnorth had seen. These private studies led to Quake developing a thirst for knowledge and understanding which also led to her becoming slightly self-important. Quake lives to better her skills so that she can become the purest form of herself, unaffected by the thoughts of others Quake very rarely thinks before she speaks if she speaks at all as speaking to those that she believes are beneath her is a waste of her time. Though Quake not entirely heartless Quake has one soft spot and that is those who study under her as she would gladly give her life to protect those, she chooses to call students.</p>
                <p>One day Kelkain announced that he had a gift to give to Quake and that she should come to his study later in the evening. When Quake arrived, she found Kelkain dead on the floor and his study in ruin, confused and distraught by this the only clue she had to go on was a letter addressed to her on the other side of the study inviting her to join the Everwatch.</p>

                <h2>Lyre</h2>
                <img src="/Images/Lyre.jpg"alt="A Kenku running with a lute">
                    <p>A Male Kenku Bard, while Lyre was a child his parents were murdered by a group called the Black Hand, while himself and his parents travelled on a wagon, they were overwhelmed by hooded forces though unneeded for the ritual Lyre was left alone by the overturned wagon as he watched his parents be dragged away. As Lyre sat alone while time passed, he eventually fell into a sleep and was woken when a passing group of entertainers and mercenaries found him, assuming he had been abandoned they took it upon themselves to take Lyre and raise him.</p>  
                    <p>Through his childhood Lyre leant on different members of this group who came to be known as family, he used their knowledge and experience to determine a path he would like to follow though out of the entire group Lyre found himself strongly connected to two individuals, Sarah a bard and Carjer a rogue.</p>   
                    <p>While Sarah loved performing with her violin and singing tales she had a hunger for the stage, Carjer had a love for trinkets and things of old. Carjer yearned for the exploration of ruins to feel the thrill of adventure and the need for treasure. Lyre was inseparable from them until Carjer never returned from an exploration, this feeling of loss disturbed Lyre to his very core as an unknown yet vaguely familiar feeling filled him and soon, he decided to leave his family behind to go out alone and see the world. Sarah gifted her favourite violin to Lyre as he prepared to leave with the hope that he would return it one day after he has performed with it on the very stages Sarah dreamt of.</p>  
                    <p>As a bard Lyre thrives when he is in front of an audience, the skills he learnt through his family help him to entrance, entertain and inspire those who bear witness to his performance, in Lyreâ€™s opinion he believes that art should mirror one's own emotions because only by understanding his own emotion can he then perform at the best of his ability and use the audience's emotions to enhance the performance. This thought process means that Lyre will strive for nothing but perfection in his performances anything below that is just a waste of his talents, Lyres love for attention and devotion to the stage has only worsened the hunger for more. Lyre hungers for fame and fortune to hear his name chanted across the land but the art of the game itself is not entirely lost on Lyre as he knows it's just a matter of time before he wins and Lyre knows he will win. </p>
