                <h2>Welly Tondelli</h2>
                <img src="/Images/Welly.jpg" alt="A gnome holding a rat looking for adventure">
                <p>A Female Gnome Ranger born in Gizbarrow a forest village to a small society of rock gnomes, Welly was one of the numerous children of Kerry and Terry Tondelli who ran their own mining business that each of the children would join. As a child Welly joined the Rock Gnome Rangers, a group that teaches young gnomes how to live within their society and rewards them through a series of badges. Welly being the enthusiastic child dedicated herself to achieving all the badges and managed to complete this within 3 months and then promptly left to begin working in the family business.</p>
                <p>Through working with her family Welly began to earn a small amount of money that she kept safely deposited between two large rocks that managed to fashion together to resemble a chest, after a while a saving Welly spent her hard-earned money to see a Elven boy band that she is obsessed with and still hopes to see perform again.</p>
                <p>While continuing to work in the family business Welly became fascinated by jewels that she would find and soon decided that she wanted to pursue this new fascination, though the family business mostly dealt with mining Welly decided that for her to find new jewels she would have to venture into some of the caves surrounding her village. While exploring Welly fell into a crevice in the cave and became trapped for numerous hours due to the tightness of the crevice and the panic Welly passed out, during this time a fairy found her and blessed her with fey magic that would help give her the strength to move herself from the crevice, when she awoke Welly was none the wiser to the assistance she had received.</p>
                <p>Now able to calmly move herself from the rocks, Welly was able to navigate herself to an open area in the cave where she was able to hear running water. Finding the small stream inside of the cave she decided to follow it hoping it would lead her to the lake near her village, unsure of how long she was unconscious Welly was terrified of the ordeal her family would be going through Welly rushed through the cave carefully until she came to an opening revealing what she had wished for, the lake opposite her village. Diving into the water she quickly swam across and rushed to her home to find out that her family hadn’t even noticed she was missing, Welly told them the tale that had happened, and her parents warned her not to do it again.</p>
                <p>As Welly grew she decided to leave her family business and become a Merchant of a Guild and a jeweller by trade with an eye for detail, the meticulous mind that Welly possesses has always led her to ponder on any new device, theory or blueprint which is why she whole heartedly believes that her workshop, where she spent many years learning her trade is the one true place, she knows she belongs. Although Welly believes she possesses a gift that must be shared with the world which has led to many calling her generous, Welly has an uncontrollable jealousy for any who she believes outshines her in her field which has led her to become mistrustful of other jeweller.</p>
                <p>Through her childhood and her young adult hood Welly always felt most connected to her auntie Jan who unlike her sister Kelly only had the one child called Stan. Unfortunately, Jan passed away which led to her family taking in Stan as one of their own, this loss struck a nerve with Welly as she began to realise that all her family have stayed within the village, they call home and even though they are aware of the outer world they have chosen not to go out and explore. When travelling businesses come through the town Welly always dreamed of the world behind her hills and with the loss of her auntie, she decided that she didn’t want her village to be the only place she ever knew, so Welly packed her things and decided to explore the world and hopefully discover new jewels while she is at it.</p>

                <h2>Quake</h2>
                <img src="/Images/Quake.jpg" alt="A high elf wizard casting spells">
                <p>A Female High Elf Wizard, born in Arvandor to a non particularly wealthy family Quake began to show signs of a natural talent with magic, one night her father returned home and spoke to her mother about a travelling wizard he had encountered. Telling the stranger of his daughters abilities the wizard became quite interested on taking this child with them to Tralnorth school of wizardry, initially Quakes mother was furious but realised that this would allow Quake to explore her new magic and would allow her to become something more than a basic commoner. The parents agreed and met with the travelling wizard and said their final farewells to Quake.</p>
                <p>Quakes studies at Tralnorth quickly grabbed the attention of the higher masters as her natural talent allowed her to understand complex spells easier than her classmates, a higher master by the name of Kelkian Yelastroth become quite interested in Quake and began to keep a keen eye on her as she progressed through her studies. As she grew and her natural talent allowed her to excel Kelkain offered Quake the position of his apprentice. Quake took this and became one of the youngest students to be taken on by a higher master.</p>
                <p>Through her private studies with Kelkain, Quake had a far better understanding of al her previous studies as well as the universe around her, this also led to Quake becoming one of the youngest teaching masters that Tralnorth had seen. These private studies led to Quake developing a thirst for knowledge and understanding which also led to her becoming slightly self-important. Quake lives to better her skills so that she can become the purest form of herself, unaffected by the thoughts of others Quake very rarely thinks before she speaks if she speaks at all as speaking to those that she believes are beneath her is a waste of her time. Though Quake not entirely heartless Quake has one soft spot and that is those who study under her as she would gladly give her life to protect those, she chooses to call students.</p>
                <p>One day Kelkain announced that he had a gift to give to Quake and that she should come to his study later in the evening. When Quake arrived, she found Kelkain dead on the floor and his study in ruin, confused and distraught by this the only clue she had to go on was a letter addressed to her on the other side of the study inviting her to join the Everwatch.</p>

                <h2>Lyre</h2>
                <img src="/Images/Lyre.jpg"alt="A Kenku running with a lute">
                    <p>A Male Kenku Bard, while Lyre was a child his parents were murdered by a group called the Black Hand, while himself and his parents travelled on a wagon, they were overwhelmed by hooded forces though unneeded for the ritual Lyre was left alone by the overturned wagon as he watched his parents be dragged away. As Lyre sat alone while time passed, he eventually fell into a sleep and was woken when a passing group of entertainers and mercenaries found him, assuming he had been abandoned they took it upon themselves to take Lyre and raise him.</p>  
                    <p>Through his childhood Lyre leant on different members of this group who came to be known as family, he used their knowledge and experience to determine a path he would like to follow though out of the entire group Lyre found himself strongly connected to two individuals, Sarah a bard and Carjer a rogue.</p>   
                    <p>While Sarah loved performing with her violin and singing tales she had a hunger for the stage, Carjer had a love for trinkets and things of old. Carjer yearned for the exploration of ruins to feel the thrill of adventure and the need for treasure. Lyre was inseparable from them until Carjer never returned from an exploration, this feeling of loss disturbed Lyre to his very core as an unknown yet vaguely familiar feeling filled him and soon, he decided to leave his family behind to go out alone and see the world. Sarah gifted her favourite violin to Lyre as he prepared to leave with the hope that he would return it one day after he has performed with it on the very stages Sarah dreamt of.</p>  
                    <p>As a bard Lyre thrives when he is in front of an audience, the skills he learnt through his family help him to entrance, entertain and inspire those who bear witness to his performance, in Lyre’s opinion he believes that art should mirror one's own emotions because only by understanding his own emotion can he then perform at the best of his ability and use the audience's emotions to enhance the performance. This thought process means that Lyre will strive for nothing but perfection in his performances anything below that is just a waste of his talents, Lyres love for attention and devotion to the stage has only worsened the hunger for more. Lyre hungers for fame and fortune to hear his name chanted across the land but the art of the game itself is not entirely lost on Lyre as he knows it's just a matter of time before he wins and Lyre knows he will win. </p>
