                    <h2>Salazar Brightwood(Strider)</h2>
                    <p>Born into the Brightwood family, Salazar never went without. His family where the rulers of Arcfree a city known for its delectable delights, the Brightwood family were adored by their subjects as they always looked after their own. Arcfree was known as the white city as very little crime ever occurred. </p>
                    <p>Salazar was born a twin (Marcon) though not identical they both shared enough features to be recognisable, as a child Salazar focused on learning about religion, history and politics due to the day that he would take up the mantle of responsibility of being named governor of Arcfree that was until his brother betrayed both him and his family.  </p>
                    <p>Marcon poisoned the high mage on the city council so that he could appoint a new mage, one that would assist with his plan to remove his parents from power and exile his brother so that he could take the power for himself. The new mage corrupted Salazar's mother's mind instructing her to murder her husband in his sleep, the next morning when she awoke covered in blood she confessed to the guards.  </p>
                    <p>Salazar who now was set to become governor was summoned by the city council and was given the choice of what to do with his mother, already having one parent stolen away Salazar issues life in imprisonment. Salazar's mother was taken away to the dungeon, later that night Salazar went to the dungeon to question his mother though found her unconscious. </p>
                    <p>Rushing to her aid Salazar gripped onto her lifeless corpse, within seconds guards, Marcon and the new mage stormed into the cell, convicted of murdering his own mother Salazar was to be stripped of all titles and to be exiled. Salazar spent a week imprisoned in the very cell his mother died in with no visitors, he was dead to the world.  </p>
                    <p>Until one night, Salazar was awoken by a human who was watching him sleep, after a brief conversation the man chose to believe that Salazar was innocent and gave Salazar a choice, to remain in the cell or come with him and join his order. Salazar chose the latter and has never looked back since, he had devoted his life to the Everwatch and learnt from the many Paladins and Priests at their keep. Aware of the needed tragedy to join the Everwatch, Salazar has never questioned the events that took place as he finds the memories to painful to remember.  </p>
